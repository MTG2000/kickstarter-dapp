          This is a platform that uses the technology to help creative
          developers with creative ideas to bring their ideas to life.
          <br />
          What makes us special is that we use the blockchain tech to facilitate
          the proccess of funding and refunding as much as possible.
          <br />
          Further more, there is no middle party which means that fundings go
          directly to the Developers if the campaign reaches its goal.
