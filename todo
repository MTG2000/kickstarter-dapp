Hello Exiles, It's been some time since we were last in contact with you about Wasteland 2. Since we released the Director's Cut, we've been working on other titles, including Torment: Tides of Numenera, which is in its final stage of development and releasing early next year, and The Bard's Tale IV, which is in the works at our new NOLA studio and deep in production, and looking great - in fact, we just put out a new video showing it off. But, as you might have guessed, we could never leave our crowdfunding roots behind. Today, we have launched a campaign over at Fig for the next game in the Wasteland series! For the first time, we are moving to a new platform. Fig is a relatively new crowdfunding site, and I've been on its advisory board along with others including Feargus Urquhart from Obsidian. Fig allows you to back the game and get the best value and rewards early on, and also opens the door for investors, both accredited and unaccredited. We know this is a change, but this will help ensure we can grow our games bigger and better than ever, while still being able to remain independent, keep creative control over our titles, and get to continue working on the role-playing games we love.
